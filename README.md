# Murder She Wrote

This is where I am storing my code for my group members to access for our data science project. We are working with data from the 
murder accountability project. The data is too large to store on github. The data can be downloaded [here](http://www.murderdata.org/p/data-docs.html).
We are hoping to improve upon the murder accountability project's algorithm to identify potential serial killers.

Our data science project is through the graduate program at Lipscomb University. You can read more about the program [here](https://www.lipscomb.edu/technology/graduate-programs/graduate-data-science).

(Murder She Wrote is the name we chose for our group.)
