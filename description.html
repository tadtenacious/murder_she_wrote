<p>This data is from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report. It was summarized and
<br>made available by the <a href="https://www.murderdata.org/">Murder Accountability Project</a>
<br>The blue line represnts total reported murders. And the orange line represents
Solved Murders.
<br><br>Hover over a line to get the values for Year, Total Muders, Solved
Murders, and Clearance Rate (Solved Murders / Total Murders).
<br><br>
When exploring the data, you will notice some odd occurences. For instance, if you
filter for Maine, there are years where the Cleared Murders exceed Total Murders.
Or if you filter for Illinois, there are many years without Solved murders.
